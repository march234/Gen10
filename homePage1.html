				What if you could have a finer, chef-quality meal in a casual dining setting? At Toby's Bar and Grill, we believe that fresh food isnâ€™t reserved for high prices and swanky atmospheres. 
				Every day we create fresh, flavorful, made from scratch meals. We think fresh food in a fun atmosphere will make your day just a little bit better. 
				After all, eating fresh means eating better. And don't forget to relax at our bar, where we have over 20 beers on tap.
